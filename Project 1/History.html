	   <p id="special">Cressman's General Store was purchased by local Pine Ridge residents, Ty and Tara Gillett, in August of 2019. It had been co-owned by 3 local residents prior to the Gillett's purchasing it. Cressmanâ€™s served the public with a delicious selection of home-baked items, fresh deli sandwiches, soups, or even a beerock.They are currently in the process of rebuilding.
