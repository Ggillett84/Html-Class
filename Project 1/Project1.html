	  <p id="special">Cressman's General Store has been part of the Pine Ridge community since 1904. Sitting at approximately 4,648 feet elevation, it started its beginnings by serving the loggers as a halfway point from their long trip from the valley floor to their destination at 9,000 feet elevation. It is still a big part of this community, serving locals and visitors alike as they make their way up to the beautiful Sierra Navada areas. </p>
